        Okay, so the Burger Shack isn't a real place, this is all just for show.
        It's a sham! If you want a real awesome burger in Delray Beach, I
        recommend that you check out either BurgerFi, the Office, or potentially
        even Hi-Way Burger, depending on your tastes.

        So yeah, sorry to disappoint you. This is all meant to be a portfolio
        piece for the front-end web developer Kamran. It feels weird writing
        about myself in the third person, but whatever. This is pretty much all
        placeholder text now I guess. I'm not sure what else to do with it. I 
        guess I could hide clever little quips or jokes in here, but I guess I'm
        just not clever enough.

        This all reminds me of a joke, wait, no it doesn't. Sorry to dissapoint
        you again. :(
